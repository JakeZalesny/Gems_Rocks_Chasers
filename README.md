# Overview

I really was hoping to better my understanding of C# with this project by doing an old Python project. In terms of meeting 
that goal I definitely did so. I didn't get to finish the project as I would've desired but I am satisfied with what I've 
learned and look forward to learn more of C# in supporting my team with their project.
